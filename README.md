## Mwenbwa - game rules

In a map of Liège, there will be trees. Each tree as a _value_ (which is the product of his _diameter_ by his _height_, *rounded to top*). 

When a player enter the game, he needs to create an account, will receive a random color (can be changed in profile), and will receive three random, *free* trees (and some bonus leaves, following the formula: `[total leaves of players] / [amount of players]`).  
Every fifteen minutes **in real life**, each player will receive an amount of leaves equals to the total of each of his trees.  
Every hour **in real life**, each player loose half his leaves.

Whenever he wants, a player can _buy_ a tree. 

- If the tree is *free*, the _value_ of the tree is its price. When a player buy a *free tree*, a [random name](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fantasy-name-generator) is affected to that tree.


> SOON, API done but not implemented /api/trees/geo100/<tree_id>&<username_of_buyer>
> - If the tree belongs to another player, the price is computed with the following formula: `[value of the targetted tree] + ([value of all the targetted  player's trees in 100m radius] × ([amount of trees in 100m radius] / [amount of tree of targetted player in 100m radius])) + [value of all the other players trees in 100m radius] - [value of all your tree in 100m radius]`.
>
> Whenever he wants, a player can *lock* a tree by paying the following formula: `[value of the tree] × 10 + ([value of all the trees in 100m radius] × [amount of players in 100m radius]) - ([value of all player's trees in 100m radius] / [amount of players in 100m radius])`. A *locked tree* can't be buy by another player.
>

At anytime, a player can check the *leaderboard*, to see each player score, amount of trees, etc.  

> SOON
> At anytime, a player can consult the *gamelog*, which record all actions in the game.
> 
> When clicking on a tree, a player can see its value, name, owner, history of buys, and a link to the relative wikipedia article for this tree's species (if applicable). Any player can also leave a comment on a tree.
